# Python_for_Finance

In this .py file, you will find my code for the Final Project of Python_for_Finance.
I have not added any excel file for this is pretty straightforward. 

It is on the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, using Alpha_Vantage API.

Wishing you a pleasant review, 

Clement DUQUESNE.
